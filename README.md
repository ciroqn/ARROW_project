# Using the ARROW Radio Telescope to map the Galaxy

## Aim of ARROW Project
ARROW is a radio telescope, so it can, luckily, detect signals whatever the weather (but, of course, any vibrations from the surrounding environment could have an impact). ARROW specifically **detects 21 cm radiowaves** from the abundance of hydrogen gas in the outer arms of our galaxy and the wider Galactic plane. By utilising the Doppler shift of these emissions, one can determine the speeds of the clouds of hydrogen gas. In turn, a rotation curve can be constructed from this (note that the velocity of this gas may have components in three directions). From this, the mass can be estimated.

The rotational speed of the Galaxy will be plotted as a function of distance from the centre. Since the view is restricted in the UK, archival data from the inner Galactic place will also be used for a fuller graph of the rotational speed.

## About ARROW itself

ARROW is located at the Open University's campus in Milton Keynes, and is functions as a steerable 3-metre telescope dish. It has a detector that is capable of detecting/receiving 21 cm radio emissions.

## Planning Observing Session

Targets will need to be picked that are not in the *exclusion zone*, which is the zone through which the dish cannot rotate due to hardware limitations. The exclusion zone is in `Alt/Az` coordinates:
  - 20 deg < Azimuth < 340 deg
  - 20 deg < Altitude < 80 deg

The dish takes roughly 5-6 seconds to rotate by 1 degree (so ~ 10 degrees / minute). Also, it takes around 15 seconds to run a quic scan (and 100s for a full scane), and this would be done, typically, only to confirm that the dish has been turned away from an unkown source of radio interference. Interference shows up as sharp peaks on the graph, and if these sharp peaks are close to the H1 line, then it will be necessary to shift the dish 1-2 degrees to the right or left and make a quick scan to investiage the interference.
