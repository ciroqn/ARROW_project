# Using the ARROW Radio Telescope to map the Galaxy

## Aim of ARROW Project
ARROW is a radio telescope, so it can, luckily, detect signals whatever the weather (but, of course, any vibrations from the surrounding environment could have an impact). ARROW specifically detects 21 cm radiowaves from the abundance of hydrogen gas in the outer arms of our galaxy and the wider Galactic plane. By utilising the Doppler shift of these emissions, one can determine the speeds of the clouds of hydrogen gas. In turn, a rotation curve can be constructed from this (note that the velocity of this gas may have components in three directions). From this, the mass can be estimated.

The rotational speed of the Galaxy will be plotted as a function of distance from the centre. Since the view is restricted in the UK, archival data from the inner Galactic place will also be used for a fuller graph of the rotational speed.
